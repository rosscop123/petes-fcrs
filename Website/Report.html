                <h4>Work I am proud of</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Getting a fully designed website
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Learning and using Gimp and Inkscape succesfully
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How the website looks, I think it has a great design and look to it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designing and creating my logo.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Effects I have added to images using gimp. These effects include removing unwanted items, like bottle caps, removing backgrounds, adding transparency to backgrounds etc. Images below should show this.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Searches I have done</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Finding a framework for the website. There are multiple different frameworks out there and deciding on the right for the job is a difficult task. In the end I decided on using Gumby.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finding a library for a gallery. This took the longest out of all the searches as many libraries failed to work with the restrictions placed on the website from the server. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One search I had to perform multple times was how to position things inside of CSS. Since there are so many different ways to position something, I had to find the correct way for that particalar element.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Things I have discovered</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How much easier frameworks make your life.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Positioning elements in html is time consuming (especially if you're a bt of a perfectionist)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How difficult errors become to solve (unlike programming languages). Many problems lie within how each browser is unique in someway or within library code.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Things that took a long time</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Using any libraries off the internet took the longest time since they constantly threw errors when I tried to implement them, in the online validator, in chrome's dev tools and on the server. Repeatedly trying to fix the issues were time-consuming. Libraries or frameworks I attempted to use/used included Gumby, slick (photo gallary), jssor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Researching ways to do things and finding the correct way for what I want. What I found is that there is too much information online about web technologies, which makes sorting through it to find the piece I need lots of effort.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Working out a design for the website. Creating a rough design on paper took much longer than I thought it would. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Inserting HTML code into other HTML files rather than having repeated code. For example the navbar is in a file called navbar.html and it is include in all other html files using javascript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Modal boxes for enlarging images in the gallery for each of the dogs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Parallax between the background and any scrollable content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Form for contacting the owner of the web page (for which the submit button isn't completed, waiting on server side instructions).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Tools and techniques</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Gumby was used as the website's framework.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slick was a library I used for the gallery slider under each dog.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inkscape was used in the creation of the logo.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gumpy was used in almost all of the images on the page to scale the images, create thumbnails, compress the image file sizes and finally to add effects.
                    </li>
                </ul>
