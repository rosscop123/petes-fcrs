Fairly short drive, considering the other places we have been. After arriving we took a quick rest before the judging commenced!\r\nSunni, looking as hansome as ever, entered the ring in the first round, which he took by storm. He gradually progressed through the rounds before reaching the final round of the graduate group. What did he do? He only went and won it!\r\nAfter winning the grad event he was entered into the round for Best of Breed. He made it to the final three! It was close between them all, but Sunni was too much for any of them and took home first place.\r\nOur Sunni did us proud.","imgDir":null,"date":"Sun May 10 2015 15:26:32 GMT+0100 (BST)"}]
